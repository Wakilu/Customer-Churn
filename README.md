# Customer-Churn

 Customer Churn Prediction Analysis Using Ensemble Techniques (Banking)

## Problem statement :

A bank has been observing a lot of customers closing their accounts or switching to competitor banks over the past couple of quarters. As such, this has caused a huge dent in the quarterly revenues and might drastically affect annual revenues for the ongoing financial year, causing stocks to plunge and market cap to reduce. A team of business, product, engineering and data science folks have been put together to arrest this slide. 

__Objective__ : Can we build a model to predict, with a reasonable accuracy, the customers who are going to churn in the near future? Being able to accurately estimate when they are going to churn will be an added bonus

__Definition of churn__ : A customer having closed all their active accounts with the bank is said to have churned. Churn can be defined in other ways as well, based on the context of the problem. A customer not transacting for 6 months or 1 year can also be defined as to have churned, based on the business requirements
